  <hr size = "5" color="blue"><br>

  Also, I learned today about the attribute of the tags that are used to customized the tags

  <h4> www.codepen.io : </h4> This is one of the great site to practice the changes that you make and to look simultaneously

  <h4> www.devdocs.io : </h4> This is one of the greatest place to look for the documentation of html regarding the tags and the attributes that they have and that we can use.

   <h4> www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661 :  </h4> This is the site that we used for content <br>
   <hr size = "5" color = "red"><br>
  One of the tips is that you can visit any site and right click on the elements that you want to know the attribute values of and select inspect to know about the exact configuration.
